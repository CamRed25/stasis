        Stasis is a smart idle manager for Wayland that understands context.
        It automatically prevents idle when watching videos, reading documents,
        or playing music, while allowing idle when appropriate. Features include
        media-aware idle handling, application-specific inhibitors, Wayland idle
        inhibitor protocol support, and flexible configuration using the RUNE
        configuration language.
